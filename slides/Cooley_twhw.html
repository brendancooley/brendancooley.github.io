  ## Introduction
  ### Motivation
]

.right-column[

**Bargaining Models of Conflict**
  - Conflict of interest taken as given
  - Extremal (but oft-used case): bargainers have homogenous preferences over consumption of some private good
  - Say, *territory*

**Bargaining over Policies and Externalities**
  - Intergovernmental bargaining often revolves around 
    1. Which domestic policies will be adopted
    2. Who will bear costs of adjustment induced by changes from status quo
  - Examples: trade, investment, monetary, and environmental policies
  - Heterogenous policy preferences `\(\implies\)` heterogeneous conflicts of interest

  ### Trade Policy
]

.right-column[

**Protection for Sale**
  - Trade policy generates externalities (when country is 'large')
    - Home tariff increases impose costs on *foreign* exporters
  - Magnitude of externality varies with degree of government capture
    - Governments more sensitive to producer interests endeavor to adopt more distortionary policies (Grossman and Helpman 1994)

**Trade Wars and Hot Wars**
  - Governments have both militarized and nonmilitarized tools to influence policy choices abroad
    - Nonmilitarized: noncooperative trade policy (Grossman and Helpman 1995)
    - Militarized: foreign-imposed regime change

  ### Preview
]

.right-column[

1. Domestic political economy of trade defines governments' policy preferences
2. Governments bargain with one another over bilateral trade policies
3. Bargaining occurs under the shadow of noncooperative trade policy *and* militarized conflict
  - War results in imposition of 'puppet' government in losing state, preferences of puppet determined by victor
4. (Extension) Endogenous military investment

**Questions**

1. Are more representative governments less conflict-prone?
2. Does international economic integration promote peace?
3. Are commercial policies determined by primarily by domestic political characteristics or international structural factors?

**Demand**

- Two-country `\((i, j)\)`, two good `\((0, 1)\)`, Ricardo-Viner model of trade
- Representative consumer utility (quasilinear):
`$$U_i(\boldsymbol{q}_i) = q_{i0} + u_i(q_{i1})$$`
- `\(L_i\)` - labor endowment
- Good 0 as numeraire, produced with labor alone and crs with `\(f_{i0}^\prime(L_{i0}) = 1 \implies w_i = 1\)`

**Supply**

- `\(K_{i1}\)` - good 1 "specific factor"
- Technology: `\(f_{i1}(L_{i1}, K_{i1})\)`

**Economic Equilibrium (Definition 1)**

*Consumers*
`\begin{aligned}
\max_{\boldsymbol{q}} &amp;&amp; U_i(\boldsymbol{q}) \\
\text{subject to  } &amp;&amp;  q_0 + p_i q_{i1} \leq L_i
\end{aligned}`

*Producers*
`$$\max_{\boldsymbol{L_{i1}}} \quad p_i f_{i1}(L_{i1}, K_{i1}) - L_{i1}$$`

*Market Clearing*
`$$L_{i0} + L_{i1} = L_i$$`
`$$q_{11} + q_{21} = f_{11}(L_{11}, K_{11}) + f_{21}(L_{21}, K_{21})$$`

&lt;br /&gt;

- Demand: `\(d_i(p_i)\)`
- Supply: `\(X_i(p_i)\)`
- Net imports: `\(m_i(p_i) = d_i(p_i) - X_i(p_i)\)`

**Components of Domestic Welfare**

- Consumer Surplus
`$$S(p_i) = U_i(\boldsymbol{q}_i^\star) - p_i q_{i1}^\star - q_{i0}^\star$$`
- Producer Profits
`$$\Pi(p_i) = p_i \cdot f_{i1}(L_{i1}^\star, K_{i1}) - L_{i1}^\star(p_i)$$`
- Tariff Revenue
`$$r(\tau_i, \pi) = (\tau_i - 1) \cdot \pi \cdot m_i(\tau_i * \pi)$$`

&lt;br /&gt;

- Economic equilibrium determines how international economy will respond to arbitrary pair of tariffs, `\(\left\{ \tau_i, \tau_j \right\}\)`
- Next step: endogenize trade policy

**Influence Game (Trade Wars)**

1. Producers present contribution schedules to the government
$$
C_i:(\tau_i, \tau_j) \rightarrow \mathbb{R}
$$
2. Governments choose trade policies
3. Policies are implemented. Promised contributions accrue to the government and production and consumption occur.

**Government objective function**
`\begin{align*}
G_i(\tau_i, \tau_j) =&amp; (1 - a) C_i(\tau_i, \tau_j) + \\ 
&amp; a \left[\Pi_i(\tau_i, \tau_j) + S_i(\tau_i, \tau_j) \right] + r(\tau_i, \tau_j)
\end{align*}`

- `\(a_i \rightarrow 0\)`: pure 'kleptocrat' (contribution maximizer)
- `\(a_i \rightarrow 1\)`: pure 'technocrat' (social welfare maximizer)

**Lemma 1 (Grossman and Helpman 1994 Proposition 1):**
*For an arbitrary foreign (home) trade policy, `\(\tau_j\)`, let `\(\tau_i^0\)` denote the home government's optimal policy in the absence of political contributions `\((C_i(\tau_i, \tau_j) = 0)\)` and `\(g_i(\tau_i; \tau_j)\)` its associated welfare.
$$
\tau_i^0 \in \underset{\tau_i}{\operatorname{argmax }} \text{ } g_i(\tau_i; \tau_j)

In a domestic political economic equilibrium, the government chooses trade policy to maximize a weighted sum of producer and social welfare

$$
C_i^\star(\tau_i^0, \tau_i^\star; \tau_j) = \Pi_i(\tau_i^\star, \tau_j) + a S_i(\tau_i^\star, \tau_j) + r(\tau_i^\star, \tau_j) - g_i(\tau_i^0; \tau_j)

**Trade Wars (Definition 2):** In a noncooperative Nash Equilibrium, government trade policies maximize their contribution-induced utility and constitute best responses to one another
$$
\tau_i^\star \in \underset{\tau_i}{\operatorname{argmax}} \text{ }
 \Pi_i(\tau_i, \tau_j^\star) + a_i S_i(\tau_i, \tau_j^\star) + r(\tau_i, \tau_j^\star)

Political contributions, `\(C_i^\star(\tau_i^0, \tau_i^\star, ;\tau_j^\star)\)`, satisfy Lemma 1.

Features of trade wars equilibrium: 

1. Governments' choices of trade policy demonstrate strategic complementarity (best response curves are increasing and concave)
2. Governments' objective functions satisfy increasing differences in `\((\tau_i, a_i)\)`

Objective Function:
`$$G(\tau_i; a_i) = \Pi(\tau_i) + a_i S(\tau_i) + r(\tau_i)$$`

`\((-) G(\tau_i, a_i)\)` satisfies increasing differences:
$$
G(\tau_i; a_i) - G(\tau_i^\prime; a_i) \leq  G(\tau_i; a_i^\prime) - G(\tau_i^\prime; a_i^\prime)
$$

*Translation - lower types (more kleptocratic) choose higher tariffs*

**Lemma 2.1:** `\(\tau_i^\star(a_i)\)` is strictly decreasing in `\(a_i\)`.

*Governments that have preferences over foreign trade policy also have implicit preferences over that government's bias type*

War modeled as costly lottery in which victor can replace loser's government with puppet...puppet's bias type chosen by victor

Two questions to consider here:
1. What are governments' preferences over the bias type of their bargaining partner?
2. When and how does militarized option affect bargaining outcomes?

**Preliminaries**

- Military capability: `\(\omega_i\)`
- Contest function: `\(\rho: \left\{ \omega_i, \omega_j \right\} \rightarrow [0, 1]\)`
  - increasing and weakly concave in `\(\omega_i\)`
  - decreasing and weakly convex in `\(\omega_j\)` 
  - satisfies law of total probability `\(\rho(\omega_i, \omega_j) + \rho(\omega_j, \omega_i) = 1\)`

**Bargaining Game**

- `\(j\)` makes take it or leave it proposal consisting of bilateral trade policy and side payment `\(\left\{ \tau_i, \tau_j, R^j \right\}\)`&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
- `\(i\)` takes one of three actions
  1. Accept offer, `\(\left\{ \tau_i, \tau_j, R^j \right\}\)` implemented
  2. Reject offer and implement noncooperative trade policy, yielding `\(G_i(\tau_i^\star, \tau_j^\star)\)` (Definition 2)
  3. Declare war, yielding `$$\tilde{G}_i = \left( \rho(\omega_i, \omega_j) \overline{G}_i + (1 - \rho(\omega_i, \omega_j)) \underline{G}_i \right) (1 - c_i)$$`

.footnote[

[1] Assumption that side payments are available is innocuous. Grossman and Helpman (1995) show that an arbitrary division of bargaining surplus can be implemented using tariffs only through tariff revenue mechanism.

**Lemma 3:**

G_i^t \left( \tau_i^t, \tau_j^t, R^j(a_i, a_j) \right) = G_i(\tau_i^t, \tau_j^t) + R^j(a_i, a_j) = G_i \left( \tau_i^\star(a_i), \tau_j^\star(a_j) \right)

*pure trade talks leaves `\(i\)` indifferent between `\(j\)`'s proposal and trade wars*

**Bias Type Preferences**

**Counterfactual Trade Policies**

**Lemma 4:** Let `\(\left\{ \tau_i^\prime, \tau_j^\prime \right\}\)` denote the trade policies that emerge in the counterfactual trade wars equilibrium in which governments' bias parameters are `\(\left\{ a_i, k(a_i) \right\}\)` and `\(\left\{ \tau_i^\star, \tau_j^\star \right\}\)` denote the policies associated with `\(\left\{ a_i, a_j \right\}\)`. Then
`$$k(a_i) &gt; a_j \implies \left\{ \tau_i^\prime, \tau_j^\prime \right\} \ll \left\{ \tau_i^\star, \tau_j^\star \right\}$$`
and
`$$k(a_i) &lt; a_j \implies \left\{ \tau_i^\prime, \tau_j^\prime \right\} \gg \left\{ \tau_i^\star, \tau_j^\star \right\}$$`

[Proof](LINK3)

**Definition 4:** Let `\(\tilde{a}_i\)` define the (unbounded) type of home government that desires no change in the type of the foreign government
`$$\tilde{a}_i(a_j) = \left\{ a_i | k(a_i) = a_j \right\}$$`

`$$\left[ \underline{G}_i \left( k(a_j), a_j; a_i \right) + \rho(\omega_i, \omega_j) \Gamma_i(a_i, a_j) \right] (1 - c_i) &gt;\\ G_i(\tau_i^\star(a_i), \tau_j^\star(a_j))$$`

**Proposition 2:** For any draw from `\(F_j\)`, the probability that hot wars binds is increasing in the magnitude of the `\(i\)`'s conflict of interest with `\(j\)`, `\(\Gamma(a_i, a_j)\)`. 

[Proof](LINK7)

**Substantive Significance**

- If hot wars is relevant for bargaining, we should expect states to maintain competent and ready military postures to ensure implicit threats are taken seriously
- By contrast, countries that engage in pure 'trade talks' need only make trade sanctions credible
- More kleptocratic dyads more likely to rely on militarized outside option

**3 scenarios to consider:**

1. Set `\(\omega_i = 0\)`, yielding either trade wars utility or `\(\tilde{G}_i(0, \omega_j)\)`
2. Ensure that hot wars does not bind for `\(j\)`, invest `\(\omega_i^\star\)` where `\(\omega_i^\star\)` solves
`$$\left( \underline{G}_j \left( k(a_i), a_i; a_j \right) + \rho(\omega_i^\star, \omega_j) \Gamma_j(a_j, a_i) \right) (1 - c_j) = \\ G_j(\tau_j^\star(a_j), \tau_i^\star(a_i))$$`
yielding utility `\(G_i(\tau_i^\star(a_i), \tau_j^\star(a_j)) - z(\omega_i^\star)\)`
3. Invest optimally for hot wars
$$
\frac{\partial \tilde{G}_i(\omega_i,\omega_j)}{\partial \omega_i} = \frac{\partial \rho(\omega_i, \omega_j)}{\partial \omega_i} \Gamma_i(a_i, a_j) (1 - c_i) - \frac{\partial z_i(\omega_i)}{\partial \omega_i} = 0

.right-column[

**Summary of Findings**

- Among governments of interest `\((a &lt; \tilde{a})\)`, conflicts of interest grow as governments become more kleptocratic
- As conflicts of interest grow, the probability that bargaining becomes militarized increases
- Given the opportunity to invest in military capability, those with larger conflicts of interest choose larger investments

*Gerschenkron (1943): autocracy, trade protectionism, and foreign policy belligerence are intimately related*

**Commercial Peace**

1. Increase in number of democracies
2. Increase in international trade flows
3. Relative dearth of interstate conflict 

*Model takes (1) as primitive and derives (2) and (3) from single framework*

  ## Discussion

.right-column[

Bargaining model built on top of underlying political economy of trade, but results would carry through in a more general environment

**3 key assumptions:**

1. Governments choose an externality-creating policy
2. Magnitude of the externality varies monotonically as a function of the governments' types
3. Threat points include both noncooperative policy choice and militarized conflict

*Most policies of interest to IR researchers display these properties to some extent*
- Exchange rate regimes, investment protections, environmental policies

  ## Conclusion
]

.right-column[

**Implications for International Security**

- Conflict `\(\implies\)` conflict of interest
- Heterogenous preferences over externality-generating policies as basis for variation in conflicts of interest
- Preference-based (as opposed to information-based (Schultz 1998) or institutions-based (Bueno de Mesquita et al 2003)) account of democratic/commercial peace

**Implications for IPE**

- Several studies have employed Grossman-Helpman model to estimate governments' bias parameter
- If policy set under shadow of international coercion, these will overestimate representativeness
- Social welfare consciousness and latent foreign threats as basis for trade liberalization

**Lemma 1**

Government welfare maximization requires
$$
\frac{\partial C_i(\tau_i)}{\partial \tau_i} + a \left[ \frac{\partial \Pi(\tau_i) }{\partial \tau_i} + \frac{\partial S(\tau_i)}{\partial \tau_i} \right] + \frac{\partial r(\tau_i)}{\partial \tau_i} = 0
$$
Taking this behavior as given, producers implement `\(\tau_i\)` to maximize their own welfare. Producer net welfare maximization therefore requires
$$
\frac{\partial \Pi(\tau_i)}{\partial \tau_i } - \frac{\partial C_i(\tau_i)}{\partial \tau_i} = 0
$$
Substituting these conditions in for one another, we obtain
$$
\frac{\partial \Pi(\tau_i)}{\partial \tau_i} + a \left[ \frac{\partial \Pi(\tau_i) }{\partial \tau_i} + \frac{\partial S(\tau_i)}{\partial \tau_i} \right] + \frac{\partial r(\tau_i)}{\partial \tau_i} = 0
$$
which is consistent with joint welfare maximization on behalf of the government.

---
**Lemma 1 (continued)**

Given that `\(\tau_i^\star\)` will maximize joint welfare, we can determine equilibrium contributions. Note first that we must have `\(C_i(\tau_i^0) = 0\)`. If this were not the case, producers could reduce their contributions and the government's policy choice would remain unchanged, yielding a profitable deviation. This then becomes the government's individual rationality constraint. Producers will set `\(C_i(\tau_i^\star)\)` such that the government is indifferent between implementing `\(\tau_i^\star\)` and `\(\tau_i^0\)`. This indifference requires that
$$
C_i^\star(\tau_i^0, \tau_i^\star; \tau_j) = \Pi_i(\tau_i^\star, \tau_j) + a S_i(\tau_i^\star, \tau_j) + r(\tau_i^\star, \tau_j) - g_i(\tau_i^0; \tau_j)
$$
or the difference between `\(G(\tau_i^\star)\)` and `\(g_i(\tau_i^0)\)`.

---
**Lemma 2.1**

Since producer profits and tariff revenue are unweighted, the condition simplifies to comparing differences in weighted consumer surpluses
`$$a_i \left( S_i(\tau_i)- S_i(\tau_i^\prime) \right) \leq a_i^\prime \left( S_i(\tau_i)- S_i(\tau_i^\prime) \right)$$`
`\(S(\tau_i)\)` is a strictly decreasing function of `\(\tau_i\)`, which is sufficient to confirm increasing differences. Since `\((-)G(\tau_i; a_i)\)` satisfies increasing differences and `\(\tau_i \in \mathbb{R}_+\)`, optimal `\(\tau_i\)` are monotone decreasing in `\(a_i\)` by Ashworth and Bueno de Mesquita 2006 Theorem 1 (Milgrom 1994). This proves part 1.

**Lemma 2.2**

As noted in Definition 1, domestic and international prices are functions of home and foreign tariff choices, `\(p_i(\tau_i, \pi)\)`, `\(p_j(\tau_j, \pi)\)`, and `\(\pi(\tau_i, \tau_j)\)`. Since `\(i\)`'s politically optimal tariffs are in turn functions of `\(a_i\)`, these prices are each implicit functions of `\(a_i\)` as well. For any set of (bounded) prices, we can find an `\(\left\{ a_i, a_j \right\}\)` that would generate them in a trade wars equilibrium.

---
**Lemma 4**

Consider `\(k(a_i) &lt; a_j\)`. As shown in Lemma 1, governments' choice problems satisfy increasing differences - lower bias types ($a_i$) choose higher tariffs. Since both choice problems have this feature, home and foreign tariffs in trade wars Nash equilibria are also decreasing in `\(\left\{ a_i, a_j \right\}\)` by Tarski's fixed point theorem (Ashworth and Bueno de Mesquita 2006). Therefore, `\(k(a_i) &lt; a_j \implies \left\{ \tau_i^\prime, \tau_j^\prime \right\} \gg \left\{ \tau_i^\star, \tau_j^\star \right\}\)`

**Proposition 1**

By Definition 4, we know `\(a_i &lt; \tilde{a}_i(a_j) \implies k(a_i) &gt; a_j\)`. Take `\(a_i\)`, `\(a_i^\prime\)` with `\(a_i \geq a_i^\prime\)`. In Lemma 1 we have that `\((-) G(\tau_i, a_i)\)` satisfies increasing differences in `\(\left\{ \tau_i, a_i \right\}\)`. It also satisfies increasing differences in `\(\left\{ \tau_i / \tau_j, a_i \right\}\)` so `\(\tau_i^\star / \tau_j^\star\)` are monotone decreasing in `\(a_i\)`. Let `\(\tau_i / \tau_j\)` be the trade wars equilibrium ratio associated with `\(\left\{ a_i, k(a_i) \right\}\)` `\((\overline{G}(a_i))\)` and `\(\tau_i^\prime / \tau_j^\prime\)` be the ratio associated with `\(\left\{ a_i^\prime, k(a_i^\prime) \right\}\)` `\((\overline{G}(a_i^\prime))\)`. Monotone decreasingness implies `\(\tau_i^\prime / \tau_j^\prime &gt; \tau_i / \tau_j\)`. The ratio associated with `\(\left\{k(a_j), a_j \right\}\)` `\((\underline{G}(a_i))\)` does not vary with `\(a_i\)` - denote this with `\(\tau_i^0 / \tau_j^0\)`. From Lemma 2, we have 
$$
G(\tau_i; a_i) - G(\tau_i^0; a_i) \leq  G(\tau_i; a_i^\prime) - G(\tau_i^0; a_i^\prime) \leq G(\tau_i^\prime; a_i^\prime) - G(\tau_i^0; a_i^\prime)
$$
Replacing with conflicts of interest:
$$
\Gamma(a_i) \leq G(\tau_i; a_i^\prime) - G(\tau_i^0; a_i^\prime) \leq \Gamma(a_i^\prime)
$$
Which is sufficient to show that conflicts of interest are decreasing in `\(a_i\)`.

**Proposition 2:**
Let `\(\omega_j^\star\)` denote the value of `\(\omega_j\)` that solves the hot war preference inequality with equality `$$\left( \underline{G}_i \left( k(a_j), a_j; a_i \right) + \rho(\omega_i, \omega_j^\star) \Gamma(a_i, a_j) \right) (1 - c_i) = G_i(\tau_i^\star(a_i), \tau_j^\star(a_j))$$`
Clearly `\(\omega_j^\star\)` increases with `\(\Gamma(a_i a_j)\)`, as the right hand side is unaffected by changes in `\(\Gamma(a_i a_j)\)` and `\(\rho(\omega_i, \omega_j)\)` is a decreasing function of `\(\omega_j\)`. Hot wars will bind for `\(i\)` for all `\(\omega_j &lt; \omega_j^\star\)`. The probability that hot wars binds for `\(i\)` is therefore given by `$$\int_{\underline{\omega}_j}^{\omega_j^\star} f(\omega_j) d \omega_j$$`
Since `\(\omega_j^\star\)` is increasing in `\(\Gamma(a_i, a_j)\)` this quantity is also increasing in `\(\Gamma(a_i, a_j)\)`.

**Proposition 3:**
When conflicts of interest are small and optimal investment does not satisfy first order conditions, investment is invariant of `\(i\)`'s conflict of interest with `\(j\)`. So we need only consider the case in which `\(i\)` invests optimally for conflict. If the cross partial of `\(\tilde{G}_i(\omega_i,\omega_j)\)` in `\(\omega_i\)`, `\(\Gamma_i(a_i, a_j)\)` is positive, then optimal investment is increasing in `\(\Gamma_i(a_i, a_j)\)`. We can confirm this by noting
$$
\frac{\partial \tilde{G}_i(\omega_i,\omega_j, \Gamma_i)}{\partial \omega_i \partial \Gamma_i} = \frac{\partial \rho(\omega_i, \omega_j)}{\partial \omega_i}(1 - c_i)
$$
which is positive given our assumptions on `\(\rho(\omega_i, \omega_j)\)` and `\(c_i\)`.
