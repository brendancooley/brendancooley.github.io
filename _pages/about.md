Welcome! I'm currently a PhD candidate in Politics at Princeton University and a graduate student fellow in [The Program for Quantitative and Analytical Political Science (Q-APS)](https://q-aps.princeton.edu/). I study the relationship between international economics and militarized conflict, in particular how military coercion affects trade policy. Before coming to Princeton I worked at the [Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments](http://csbaonline.org/) in Washington D.C. and studied Political Science and Peace, War, & Defense at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. You can find projects in progress on [GitHub](https://github.com/brendancooley) and follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/brendanmcooley).
