Welcome! I'm currently a PhD candidate in Politics at Princeton University and a graduate student fellow in [The Program for Quantitative and Analytical Political Science (Q-APS)](https://q-aps.princeton.edu/). My research agenda lies at the intersection of international conflict and international political economy. Before coming to Princeton I worked at the [Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments](http://csbaonline.org/) in Washington D.C. and studied Political Science and Peace, War, & Defense at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. You can find projects in progress on [GitHub](https://github.com/brendancooley) and random musings on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/brendanmcooley).
