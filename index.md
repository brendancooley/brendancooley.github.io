Welcome! I'm currently a PhD student in Politics at Princeton University, where I study international and substate conflict. Before coming to Princeton I worked at the [Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments](http://csbaonline.org/) in Washington D.C. and studied Political Science and Peace, War, & Defense at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. This website is in progress,<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup> but please feel free to [email](mailto:bcooley@princeton.edu) me or follow me on [Twitter]() or [GitHub](https://github.com/brendancooley).
