I currently work as a quantitative analyst for the Los Angeles Dodgers. I received my Ph.D. in Politics at Princeton University in 2020. In my dissertation research, I estimated a model of the world political economy to quantify how military coercion affects international trade. At Princeton, I taught the Politics Departmentâ€™s summer math course for incoming graduate students, along with [Daniel Gibbs](http://www.daniel-gibbs.com/).

I'm interested in baseball, cities, open source software, and open science. I live in the Washington, DC area.
