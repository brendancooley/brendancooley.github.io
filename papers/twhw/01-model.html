<h1><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Political Economy of Trade</h1>
<p>The model envisions a two-country, two-sector international economy. The economy is composed of the producers that make each good and a representative consumer. I first define the primitives of this economy and an international equilibrium. I then proceed to introduce government and producer preferences, and allow for lobbying from owners of the specific factor. Producers seek to sway the governments’ trade policy away from the social optimum in an effort to increase their own profits. In this sense, trade protection is ‘for sale’ <span class="citation">(Grossman and Helpman 1994)</span>. This domestic influence game defines each government’s ideal trade policy, and pins down a political-economic equilibrium (trade wars) in which each government optimally responds to the other’s trade policy. I then introduce the governments’ military instruments and define the bargaining range induced by this alternative outside option. The next section discusses the theoretical results that emerge from this analysis.</p>
<p>Before jumping into the model, I briefly discuss the assumptions that underlie the domestic political economy. Governments care about some weighted average of social welfare and political contributions and set trade policy, which affects domestic consumption, production and trade flows. Political contributions are therefore used by firms to shift the governments trade policy in a manner advantageous to their interests. The framework assumes that 1) lobbying is directed at a single agent, 2) it is composed merely of ‘contributions’ and 3) that it is undertaken by a unitary actor representing the interests of the sector. Consumers are assumed to be unorganized politically. This assumption captures the difference in the magnitude of the collective action problem facing producers and consumers, respectively <span class="citation">(Olson 1965)</span>. The model simplies the domestic political economy of commercial policy quite substantially, but allows me to embed it in a broader model of international conflict while maintaining tractability. The model has the advantage of capturing the possible preferences of a wide variety of types of governments. While it was originally developed to explain trade policy formation in democracies, its structure adheres closely to the way in which theories of domestic distributional conflict conceputalize regime type in a broader sense <span class="citation">(Bueno De Mesquita et al. 2003; Acemoglu and Robinson 2005)</span>.</p>

<p>Countries produce two goods, labeled 0 and 1. For exposition here, I focus on the ‘home’ country, indexed with <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>. Primitives in the ‘foreign’ country are defined analagously. Each country hosts a representative consumer, which holds quasilinear utility <span class="math inline">\(U_i\)</span> over the consumption of two goods, where <span class="math inline">\(q_{i0}\)</span> denotes country <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>’s consumer’s consumption of good 0 and <span class="math inline">\(u_i\)</span> is some increasing and concave function with <span class="math inline">\(u_i(0) = 0\)</span>.<label for="tufte-sn-5" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">5</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-5" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">5</span> <strong>Consumer utility:</strong> <span class="math display">\[ U_i(\boldsymbol{q}_i) = q_{i0} + u_i(q_{i1}) \]</span></span> The consumer is endowed with <span class="math inline">\(L_i\)</span> units of labor which it can devote to the production of either good 0 or good 1, earning wages <span class="math inline">\(w_{i0}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(w_{i1}\)</span> respectively.</p>
<p>Good 0 serves as the numeraire (<span class="math inline">\(p_{i0} = 1\)</span>) and is produced using labor only with constant returns to scale.

p_i = \tau_i \pi
\]</span></p>
<p>Note that this formulation allows for domestic prices to be affected by both tariffs and subsidies. For an importer of good 1, <span class="math inline">\(\tau_i = 1\)</span> represents free trade, <span class="math inline">\(\tau_i &gt; 1\)</span> a tariff, and <span class="math inline">\(\tau_i &lt; 1\)</span> a subsidy.<label for="tufte-sn-9" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">9</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-9" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">9</span> The opposite holds for an exporter.</span></p>

<p>These conditions jointly determine the international price, <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>, and trade between the countries.

<p>How do producers and consumers fare under a given equilibrium? For welfare analysis, I consider the surplus that accrues to consumers and the profits that accrue to producers of the non-numeraire good. Consumer surplus is given by <span class="math display">\[

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Political-Economic Equilibrium (Trade Wars)</h2>
<p>The previous subsection characterizes how the international economy will respond to an arbitrary set of trade policies (induced prices). Now I describe the domestic political process through which those policies are determined. Note that the international price of Good 1 is determined by the trade policy choices of the governments, allowing us to write <span class="math inline">\(\pi(\tau_i, \tau_j)\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(p_i = \tau_i \pi\)</span>, domestic prices are also a function of the trade policies, giving <span class="math inline">\(p_i(\tau_i, \tau_j)\)</span>.</p>
<p>In the next subsection, I will allow governments to bargain over the bilateral trade policy, <span class="math inline">\(\left\{ \tau_i, \tau_j \right\}\)</span>. For now, I assume that the governments are engaged in a simple, noncooperative price-setting game that I will refer to as ‘trade wars,’ following <span class="citation">Grossman and Helpman (1995)</span>.<label for="tufte-sn-15" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">15</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-15" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">15</span> In the bargaining game presented in the next subsection, this will serve as one of the reversion points available to the governments.</span></p>
<p>The game proceeds as follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Producers present contribution schedules to the government, specifying the amount they will contribute for each potential pair of realized home-foreign trade policies, <span class="math inline">\(\left\{ \tau_i, \tau_j \right\}\)</span>.</li>
<li>Governments each choose trade policies.</li>
<li>Policies are implemented. Contributions accrue to the government and production and consumption occurs.</li>
</ol>
<p>This subsection characterizes the trade policies and equilibrium contributions that emerge in the Nash Equilibrium of this game. I first seek to characterize the menu of contributions that will be offered to the governments by producers. Producers seek to maximize their net welfare. Letting <span class="math inline">\(C_i(\tau_i, \tau_j)\)</span>, denote the political contributions of producers in country <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, net producer welfare can be written:<label for="tufte-sn-16" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">16</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-16" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">16</span> Since <span class="math inline">\(p_i\)</span> is a function of the trade policies, we can write <span class="math inline">\(\Pi(p_i)\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(\Pi(\tau_i, \tau_j)\)</span>.</span> <span class="math display">\[
W_i(\tau_i, \tau_j) = \Pi_i(\tau_i, \tau_j) - C_i(\tau_i, \tau_j)
\]</span></p>
<p>As discussed in the introduction, governments seek to maximize a weighted average of social welfare and political contributions. Governments are characterized by an exogenous parameter <span class="math inline">\(a_i \in [0,1]\)</span> which represents the weight they place on social welfare relative to campaign contributions. Kleptocrats <span class="math inline">\((a_i \rightarrow 0)\)</span> care only about the political contributions and the tariff revenue (or subsidy costs) induced by their policy choices. As <span class="math inline">\(a_i\)</span> approaches 1, the government becomes a pure social welfare maximizer, placing no weight on contributions. Government welfare is given by:<label for="tufte-sn-17" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">17</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-17" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">17</span> Note that this government welfare function differs slightly from that of <span class="citation">Grossman and Helpman (1994)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(G = C + a ( \Pi + r + S )\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(a \in \mathbb{R}_+\)</span>. Here, <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is bounded in the unit interval and all governments weight tariff revenue equally. The assumption that tariff revenue is unweighted for all governments ensures <span class="math inline">\(G_i\)</span> is always concave and that best response curves are smooth. In the Grossman-Helpman formulation, unrepresentative governments (<span class="math inline">\(a \rightarrow 0\)</span>) do not internalize the cost of policy interventions (<span class="math inline">\(r(\tau_i, \tau_j)\)</span>) which can yield extremely distortionary optimal policy and sometimes precludes the existence of an equilibrium.</span> <span class="math display">\[
G_i(\tau_i, \tau_j) = (1 - a) C_i(\tau_i, \tau_j) + a \left[\Pi_i(\tau_i, \tau_j) + S_i(\tau_i, \tau_j) \right] + r(\tau_i, \tau_j)
\]</span></p>
<p>Lemma 1 shows that in an equilibrium of this domestic game, contributions induce the government to maximize a weighted sum of producer welfare and social welfare.<label for="tufte-sn-18" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">18</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-18" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">18</span> Lemma 1 is a special case of Proposition 1 in <span class="citation">Grossman and Helpman (1994)</span>, which itself was an application of <span class="citation">Bernheim and Whinston (1986)</span>.</span> Equilibrium contributions are sufficient to make the government indifferent between implementing equilibrium policy and its optimal policy when <span class="math inline">\(C_i(\tau_i, \tau_j) = 0\)</span>.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> International Bargaining and Militarized Force</h2>
<p>Governments’ trade policies not only shift the domestic distribution of income, they also impose externalities, causing changes in the foreign distribution of income. Consider a tariff increase in the foreign country. As a result of higher domestic prices, imports contract and domestic producers pick up the slack. Consumers face higher prices, cutting into their welfare. The foreign government trades increases in producer surplus and tariff revenue for decreases in consumer surplus. This domestic political economy of trade is well-theorized <span class="citation">(Rogowski 1989; Grossman and Helpman 1994; Hiscox 2002)</span>. This behavior has implications for the home country as well, however. A tariff increase causes a downward shift in the international price. This causes a reduction in the profits of producers in the home country and an increase in consumption. The foreign government’s actions not only harms its own consumers, they also harm producers in the home country. When the home government weighs the interests of these producers above those of the consumers, the foreign country’s behavior imposes a negative externality.</p>
<p>Governments disatisfied with the market access conditions abroad have numerous tools at their disposal to seek changes in the trade policies of other governments. The most direct strategy is to simply solve trade conflicts through trade negotiations. Governments can trade policy concessions in order to realize pareto efficient outcomes <span class="citation">(Grossman and Helpman 1995; Davis 2004; Maggi 2016)</span>. Of course, such negotiations have distributional consequences that may favor certain actors at the expense of others. In the noncooperative trade wars game described in the previous subsection, actors that do relatively well under ‘trade wars’ secure more advantageous bargaining outcomes. If trade policy instruments are the only tools available to secure bargaining advantage, then governments with weaker preference intensity will be forced to adopt trade policies closer to the ideal points of their trade partners. When trade policy conflicts of interest are sufficiently intense, these governments might prefer to tie non-trade inducements (positive or negative) to trade negotiations. The further the range of trade-only bargains is from a given government’s ideal point, the greater its incentives to manipulate others’ incentives through coercion. In the anarchy of world politics, coercion can always - in principle - take the form of threats, displays, or uses of military force <span class="citation">(Fearon 1997)</span>.<label for="tufte-sn-20" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">20</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-20" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">20</span> Instances of ‘gunboat diplomacy’ - in which military threats were unambiguously tied to market access conditions - are not difficult to find in the historical record.</span> The question considered here is under what circumstances governments will find pure trade negotiations insufficient to their ends and will be willing to risk military conflict to pursue these ends.</p>
<p>Here, I assume that war can be employed to replace a government with a type of the victor’s choosing. In the context of the model presented in the previous subsection, this means forcibly changing the <span class="math inline">\(a_i\)</span> parameter that conditions the foreign government’s choice of trade policy. Since <span class="math inline">\(a_i\)</span> determines the ideal bilateral trade policy of each government, war can be used to move the ideal point of a trading partner closer to one’s own. This in turn moves the reversion point of the trade policy bargaining game and the set of feasible bargaining outcomes.<label for="tufte-sn-21" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">21</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-21" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">21</span> This also imposes limits on the magnitude of concessions that can be extracted through war. If the home government had control of both trade policy instruments <span class="math inline">\(\left\{ \tau_i, \tau_j \right\}\)</span>, it could use this power to redistribute an arbitrary amount of utility from the foreign government to itself <span class="citation">(See Grossman and Helpman 1995, 699–700)</span>. Because victorious governments only get to choose the (bounded) type of their negotiating partner, they can only obtain the concession that the most-favorable type of partner government would be willing to grant.</span> When contemplating a war, therefore, governments consider both the costs of the war and the benefits they would accrue if they were able to bargain with a partner holding more ‘dovish’ trade policy preferences. They also consider the outcome in which they lose a war and are replaced by a government of the foreign country’s choosing. In this case, the trade policy negotiated by the foreign-installed government is implemented, but the welfare changes resulting from the policy change are weighted by the old government’s utility function.<label for="tufte-sn-22" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">22</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-22" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">22</span> This assumption is consistent with the conceptualization of the government as an aggregation of substate actors. When contemplating a war, this aggregation considers its (weighted) change in welfare as a result of the imposition of new trade policies under the foreign-installed government. Importantly, unlike most bargaining and war games, this aggregation does not cease to exist (<span class="math inline">\(G_i \neq 0\)</span>) in the case of a war defeat.</span></p>
<p>The interaction between the governments proceeds as follows. I consider a bargaining game in which governments can choose whether to settle their differences through pure ‘trade talks’ <span class="citation">(Grossman and Helpman 1995)</span> or through the use of military force. Governments are each endowed with some exogenously-given military capability <span class="math inline">\(\omega_i \in \mathbb{R}_+\)</span>.<label for="tufte-sn-23" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">23</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-23" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">23</span> A possible extension to the model would endogenize military capability and seek to explain states’ military investment decisions as a function of political/economic primitives. This might be a more tractable dependent variable than conflict. Feedback welcome here.</span> A contest function <span class="math inline">\(\rho: \left\{ \omega_i, \omega_j \right\} \rightarrow [0, 1]\)</span> determines the probability that government <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> prevails in war for control of the type of <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>’s government. This contest function is assumed to be increasing and weakly concave in <span class="math inline">\(\omega_i\)</span>, to be decreasing and weakly convex in <span class="math inline">\(\omega_j\)</span> and to satisfy the law of total probability <span class="math inline">\(\rho(\omega_i, \omega_j) + \rho(\omega_j, \omega_i) = 1\)</span>.<label for="tufte-sn-24" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">24</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-24" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">24</span> The commonly used ‘additive’ contest function <span class="citation">(Jia, Skaperdas, and Vaidya 2013)</span> satisfies these conditions for <span class="math inline">\(\omega \in \mathbb{R}_{++}\)</span> with <span class="math display">\[ \rho(\omega_i, \omega_j) = \frac{\omega_i}{\omega_i + \omega_j} \]</span></span> If either state chooses to engage in a war, both governments pay fixed proportion of their post-war welfare, denoted <span class="math inline">\(c_i \in [0,1]\)</span>. Country <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> wins the war with probability <span class="math inline">\(\rho(\omega_i, \omega_j)\)</span> and can then replace <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>’s government with an alternative government of its choosing. The value of winning a war stems from the ability to choose the type of government that one will bargain with in future trade policy negotiations. Of course, if <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> loses the war, then <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> replaces <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>’s government.</p>
<p>In the bargaining game, government <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> offers a trade policy pair <span class="math inline">\(\left\{ \tau_i^j, \tau_j^j \right\}\)</span> and some side payment <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> to country <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>.<label for="tufte-sn-25" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">25</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-25" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">25</span> <span class="citation">Grossman and Helpman (1995)</span> prove the distributional equivalence between 1) a fixed trade policy pair <span class="math inline">\(\left\{ \tau_i^j, \tau_j^j \right\}\)</span> and a side payment and 2) a fixed trade policy ratio (<span class="math inline">\(\tau_i / \tau_j\)</span>) and a trade policy ‘level’ <span class="math inline">\(\tau_j\)</span>. Essentially, they show that governments can use trade policy to implement an arbitrary division of utility through its affect on tariff revenues (or subsidy costs). I introduce a side payment here to distinguish between efficiency and distributional considerations, but the analysis holds if governments are prohibited from using side payments. Unlike in <span class="citation">Grossman and Helpman (1995)</span>, the side payment is assumed to contribute directly to governments’ utilities, where <span class="math display">\[G_i^t = G_i(\tau_i, \tau_j) + R\]</span></span> Then, country <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> takes one of three actions.<label for="tufte-sn-26" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">26</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-26" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">26</span> May try to introduce generalized bargaining protocol in future iterations, but TIOLI easiest for now.</span></p>

<p>This requires reasoning backward from the expected outcome of such a ‘hot war.’ Suppose, without loss of generality, that country <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> wins the war.

<p>In the bargaining game described in Lemma 2, the governments choose the pareto efficient trade policy, and then redistribute income amongst themselves such that <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> is indifferent between the realized bargain and the trade wars outcome. The resulting utility for government <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, therefore, is dependent on both its own type <span class="math inline">\(a_i\)</span>, but also the type of its negotiating partner, <span class="math inline">\(a_j\)</span>. Taking this bargain as given, what type of government would country <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> most like to bargain with? Since government <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> will receive <span class="math inline">\(\overline{G}_i(\tau_i^t, \tau_j^t; a_i, a_j)\)</span> in any bargain, it would like to choose <span class="math inline">\(a_j\)</span> to maximize this quantity. Definition 3 describes this ideal negotiating partner.</p>
<hr align="left", width="30%">
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Definition 3:</strong> If country <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> wins a war with country <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>, it will install a puppet government of type <span class="math inline">\(a_j^{i \star} \in [0,1]\)</span> where <span class="math display">\[

<hr align="left", width="30%">
<p>The utility the victorious government receives, <span class="math inline">\(\overline{G}_i\)</span> is simply its utility under the bargaining game in which it optimally chooses the type of its trading partner. The utility of the losing government is slightly more complicated. <span class="math inline">\(\underline{G}_j\)</span> is determined by how the <em>old</em> government evaluates the policy agreed upon by the victor and the <em>new</em> puppet government. It is therefore a function of the original type of country <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>’s government, <span class="math inline">\(a_j\)</span>, the type of the victorious government, <span class="math inline">\(a_i\)</span>, and the type of the puppet installed by the victor, <span class="math inline">\(a_j^{i \star}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Because of the efficiency of the bargaining game, these outcomes remain purely counterfactual scenarios. Yet, under certain circumstances, governments rely on these counterfactuals to achieve advantageous bargaining outcomes. In the next section, I argue that dyads that rely on these outside options are likely to interact differently than those for which pure trade talks determine outcomes. I also show that the likelihood of these counterfactual scenarios becoming relevant on the game tree laid out above varies systematically as a function of governments’ type.</p>
