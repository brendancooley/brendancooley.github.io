<h1><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Conclusion</h1>
<p>This paper began by asking: what do governments want, and why do their objectives bring them into conflict with one another? If strong conflicts of interest were endemic to international relations and plagued all dyads equally, then this question would be of little consequence. There are strong reasons to suspect that governments of different stripes have very different objectives. Here, I have shown that this variation affects governments’ conflict propensity. In equilibrium, highly representative states impose relatively small externalities on one another, meaning that the bilateral trade policies they would adopt if they controlled the foreign government differ little from the equilibrium amount of protection. By contrast, highly unrepresentative states not only set high levels of protection in equilibrium, they also more highly prize market access abroad. This means that their returns to foreign liberalization are large, increasing the size of their dyadic conflicts of interest. Consistent with <span class="citation">Jackson and Morelli (2007)</span>, this study shows that conflicts of interest vary dramatically as a function of governments’ ‘bias’ toward particularistic interests. Unbiased governments have little reason to fight other unbiased governments because their optimal policy choices are largely harmonious in the realm of trade. Biased, rent-seeking governments, exhibit more conflictual preferences. The likelihood that military power becomes relevant in determining bargaining outcomes increases as conflicts of interest grow larger. This helps explain not just the dearth of armed conflict between highly representative governments, but their general lack of foreign policy antagonism toward one another.<label for="tufte-sn-41" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">41</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-41" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">41</span> <em>TODO add discussion about extent to which trade policy conflicts of interest play primary role in determining total conflict of interest</em></span></p>
<p>In addition to providing a self-contained account of the stylized facts of Coe’s ‘modern economic peace,’ the model has implications for empirical IPE scholars studying the relationship between democracy and trade liberalization. Several studies have employed the Grossman-Helpman model to structurally estimate governments’ welfare-consciousness cross-nationally <span class="citation">(Goldberg and Maggi 1999; Mitra, Thomakos, and Ulubasoglu 2006; Gawande, Krishna, and Olarreaga 2009; Gawande, Krishna, and Olarreaga 2012; Gawande, Krishna, and Olarreaga 2015)</span>. All use as estimating equations the predicted equilibrium protection of a small country taking an international price as given <span class="citation">(Grossman and Helpman 1994)</span> or a large country engaged in efficient ‘trade talks’ <span class="citation">(Grossman and Helpman 1995)</span>. If governments are indeed all engaged in pure ‘trade talks’ when negotiating trade regimes, then these models should produce accurate estimates of governments’ underlying welfare-consciousness. If, however, governments set trade policy under the shadow of militarized coercion, these estimates will be biased. This estimation procedure, when seeing low levels of protection, infers that governments must place a relatively small weight on political contributions. In this model, governments can adopt low levels of protection either because they are not rent seekers <em>or</em> because they face a threat of force from a trading partner that seeks market access. Kleptocrats whose markets are pried open by threats of force adopt the same trade policies as democrats who adopt such policies because they benefit consumers.</p>
<p>In future work, I plan to combine data on military spending, trade restrictiveness, and trade flows to reestimate governments’ welfare consciousness and implied bilateral conflicts of interest in an <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>-country framework. The model suggests that for a fixed balance of military power, political relations will become more militarized and antagonistic as conflicts of interest grow larger. International dyadic event data might allow for the measurement of such foreign policy antagonisms and international rivalries.<label for="tufte-sn-42" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">42</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-42" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">42</span> See: <a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/icews" class="uri">https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/icews</a></span></p>
<p>The theory highlights a prerequisite for international conflict that is underappreciated in the existing literature. For governments to initiate war with one another, they must both 1) possess conflicts of interest large enough to justify the costs of conflict and 2) be unable to resolve these conflicts peacefully. Theoretical research on international conflict has focused principally on identifying conditions under which 2) does not obtain. But understanding the emergence of conflicts of interest is arguably as or more important than understanding bargaining failures for identifying what types of governments are most likely to experience hostile international relations. Interstate war is incredibly rare in contemporary international politics, but many dyads still experience antagonistic and militarized political relations. Focusing attention on the conflicts of interest underlying these antagonisms, rather than realized conflict, might help explain their emergence and conclusion.</p>
