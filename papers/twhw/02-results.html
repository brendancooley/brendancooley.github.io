<h1><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Results</h1>
<p>The previous section developed a bargaining game in which governments welfare is dependent on bilateral trade policies, but they have both trade and non-trade (military) tools to pursue their policy objectives. This section presents the main results of the paper. In particular, it shows that the extent to which governments must rely on their militarized tools in pinning down bargaining outcomes varies as a function of their types. Kleptocratic governments, because of their profit-shifting incentives, have more conflicting preferences, and are more likely to lean on militarized options to achieve their objectives. Representative governments, by contrast, have a more nuanced view of international price changes, because they weigh the interests of both producers (that want higher prices) and consumers (that want lower prices). These countervailing forces mollify conflicts of interest between representative governments and make it more likely that such governments will be able to realize pareto efficient outcomes through pure ‘trade talks.’ Here, I define conflicts of interest in relation to the model presented in the previous section. Proposition 1 establishes that conflicts of interest become more severe as governments become more kleptocratic. I then ask, given a distribution of foreign country military capabilities, what is the likelihood that the ‘hot wars’ outside option will bind in determining bargaining outcomes. Proposition 2 establishes that ‘hot wars’ is more likely to bind for less representative types.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="02-results.html#fig:bs">3.1</a> depicts the bargaining game for the parametric model presented above. The first panel shows both governments’ best response curves and the ‘trade wars’ bilateral trade policy that is realized at their intersection. The points IP1 and IP2 correspond to the bilateral trade policies that are implemented when countries 1 and 2 choose the type of their bargaining partner. The dotted ‘efficiency locus’ depicts the set of bilateral trade policies that maximize joint surplus. This can be thought of as a ‘distributional axis.’ Governments have strictly conflicting preferences over where on this ray bilateral trade policy will settle.<label for="tufte-sn-31" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">31</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-31" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">31</span> This also generates the one-to-one mapping between bargains with and without side payments.</span> As discussed above, however, the set of feasible policies is (implicitly) limited by the bounded set (<span class="math inline">\(a_i \in [0,1]\)</span>) of government types. The second panel depicts the distributional implications of these trade policies. The solid diagonal line is the set of pareto efficient agreements. Beneath this line are the ‘trade wars’ and ‘hot wars’ reversion points. ‘Hot wars’ is depicted as a costly lottery - a convex combination of the outcome in which <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> wins the war (war1) and the outcome in which <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> wins the war (war2).<label for="tufte-sn-32" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">32</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-32" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">32</span> Recall that governments are risk-neutral with respect to costly lotteries.</span> The dotted lines emanating from these points toward the pareto frontier enclose the set of induced utilities that are preferred by both governments to a given outside option. These sets make it relatively easy to see when the ‘hot wars’ outside option will bind.<label for="tufte-sn-33" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">33</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-33" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">33</span> The set of cases in which ‘hot wars’ binds can be larger, depending on the specifics of the bargaining protocol. In the case of no intersection, ‘hot wars’ will bind for <em>all</em> bargaining protocols.</span> When these sets do not intersect, at least one government prefers initiating a hot war to <em>any</em> agreement in the ‘trade wars’ set. In accordance with the bargaining game described above, ‘hot wars’ will therefore bind in determining bargaining outcomes.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Bilateral Conflicts of Interest</h2>
<p>Modulating the underlying parameters of the model shown in <a href="02-results.html#fig:bs">3.1</a> shows that the nature of the bargaining space changes as a function of economic and political primitives. To analyze exactly how the bargaining space changes, we first must establish 1) what policies governments adopt as a function of their type and 2) how governments of different types weigh different bilateral trade policies.</p>
<p>Lemma 3 seeks to establish properties of <span class="math inline">\(G_i^w(a_i, a_j)\)</span> in order to facilitate this analysis. It demonstrates that the optimal trade policy is strictly decreasing in the governments’ representativeness. More representative governments adopt lower import tariffs (export subsidies). It also establishes an equivalence between changes in a foreign government’s type and expected changes in home and international prices. This allows us to think of the installation of a foreign puppet in terms of its welfare effects on the home government.</p>

<p>How severe are the distributional outcomes of a hot war? Are governments largely indifferent between the policies they and their puppet would implement, or does their welfare depend strongly on who is in power at home and abroad? These questions define the stakes of the international negotiation and the strategic means governments will employ to pursue their objectives.</p>
<p>I define government <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>’s conflict of interest with <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> to be the difference in <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>’s welfare when it wins a hot war versus when it loses a hot war and trade wars is implemented.<label for="tufte-sn-34" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">34</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-34" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">34</span> This yields equivalent utility to a bargained outcome in which <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> makes take-it-or-leave-it offers to <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>.</span> In the case in which <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> wins the war, it installs a puppet in <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> which implements optimal policies. When <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> loses, it is replaced by a puppet that implements policies closer to <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>’s preferences. The welfare difference for <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> between these two scenarios is taken to be the conflict of interest. Note that this conflict of interest, unlike standard models of bargaining and war, is not symmetric. The ‘pie’ at stake in the negotiation over trade policies may be valued differently by each government - <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>’s preference intensity may be stronger than <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>’s or vice versa. Definition 4 specifies this conflict of interest formally.</p>
<hr align="left", width="30%">
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Definition 4:</strong> Government <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>’s conflict of interest with <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> is given by: <span class="math display">\[

</blockquote>
<hr align="left", width="30%">
<p>Naturally, the magnitude of this conflict of interest depends on the form of the government’s welfare function, modulated by <span class="math inline">\(a_i\)</span>. As established by Lemma 3, government’s preferences over the type of their negotiating partner are fully determined by the implied domestic and international price changes that correspond to changes in negotiating partner type. Depending on the government’s type, it may prefer higher or lower domestic prices. More kleptocratic governments prefer to have higher prices, while more representative governments will have more nuanced preferences. To ease analysis of conflicts of interest, consider the case in which a government is indifferent between domestic price increases and domestic price decreases, and denote this government’s type with <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{a} \in [0,1]\)</span>.<label for="tufte-sn-35" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">35</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-35" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">35</span> <em>TODO need to prove that this exists and is unique in a general setting.</em></span> By Lemma 3.1, governments with <span class="math inline">\(a_i &lt; \tilde{a}\)</span> will prefer higher prices, while those with <span class="math inline">\(a_i &gt; \tilde{a}\)</span> will prefer lower prices.<label for="tufte-sn-36" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">36</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-36" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">36</span> <em>TODO insert two by two of different combinations of <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>s above and below <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{a}\)</span>.

Such governments therefore prefer to negotiate with foreign governments that set <em>lower</em> tariffs (<span class="math inline">\(a_j \rightarrow 1\)</span> by Lemma 3) and allow for increases in domestic prices. Conflicts of interest emerge from the externalities that the foreign government imposes on the home government through its trade policy. Proposition 1 states that such conflicts of interest become more intense as the home government becomes more kleptocratic.<label for="tufte-sn-38" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">38</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-38" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">38</span> <em>next version of paper will show that these conflicts of interest dominate those between govs with <span class="math inline">\(a_i &gt; \tilde{a}\)</span> in magnitude. should be straightforward given competing effects on <span class="math inline">\(\Pi\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> in the latter case.</em></span></p>

<hr align="left", width="30%">
<p>Why do more kleptocratic governments experience larger conflicts of interest with their trading partners? The logic of Proposition 1 is relatively straightforward. As political contributions (implicitly, producer profits) come to dominate a government’s objective function, it has less ambiguous preferences over prices. Higher prices are better. This increases the premium these governments place on being able to control the policy choices of their neighbors, which allows them to extract more rents from domestic producers. This increases the returns to victorious hot wars. By the same token, the consequences of defeats in hot wars are more stark. Highly kleptocratic governments, suffer more when forced live under the lower tariffs imposed by puppet governments. Producer welfare falls and while consumer welfare rises, more kleptocratic governments care about these gains less.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="02-results.html#fig:heatmap">3.2</a> shows how bilateral conflicts of interest change as a function of the governments’ representativeness. The x axis depicts government 1’s representativeness (<span class="math inline">\(a_1\)</span>) and the y axis shows government 2’s representativeness (<span class="math inline">\(a_2\)</span>).

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Militarized and Non-Militarized Bargaining</h2>
<p>Conflicts of interest are not sufficient to generate conflict. As <span class="citation">Fearon (1995)</span> shows, so long as war is costly, there will exist bargains prefered to war and these bargains will be realized in games with perfect information with no commitment problems. These conditions obtain in the model presented here and conflict does not occur in equilibrium. The above analysis of conflicts of interest was focused on establishing the form of the bargaining space induced by interactions between governments with Grossman-Helpman style domestic political economies. It showed that the pie at stake in the negotiation and governments’ valuation of that pie varies as a function of their type.</p>
<p>Large conflicts of interest need not even guarantee that the militarized outside option binds in pinning down bargaining outcomes. Which outside option binds is a function of both the magnitude of the conflict of interest and the distribution of military capabilities between the governments. When the trade wars and hot wars outside options deliver similar distributional outcomes, the trade wars will be sufficient to determine the equilibrium trade policy. When one country can ensure itself better distributional outcomes through hot wars than trade wars, then hot wars will bind.</p>
<p>International relations between countries that rely on only trade policy threats to determine bargaining outcomes are likely to differ substantially from those that require some latent militarized threat. Countries that engage in pure ‘trade talks’ need only to make trade sanctions credible. By contrast, countries that use implicit threats of force to deliver favorable bargaining outcomes may have incentives to mobilize their militaries to ensure that such threats are taken seriously, particularly when information about capabilities is private or mobilizations increase military effectiveness <span class="citation">(Fearon 1997)</span>. This subsection analyzes the conditions under which different patterns of international relations are likely to materialize. In particular, it analyzes the likelihood that ‘hot wars’ will bind in determining bargaining outcomes, when its trading partner’s military capabilities (<span class="math inline">\(\omega_i\)</span>) are drawn from some probability distribution. This mirrors the international security environment states face in a real, <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>-country international system. The face multiple prospective adversaries (or partners), each with varying military capabilities. The probability of ‘hot wars’ binding can therefore be thought of as the percentage of countries for which military relations (rather than pure trade talks) determines bargaining outcomes.</p>
<p>For ease of exposition, consider the case in which the foreign country, <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>, has proposal power, both before and after hot wars. This makes it relatively straightforward to determine under what conditions country <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> will prefer to initiate a hot war, and when this option will bind in determining bargaining outcomes. In the case of a hot war, the victor will replace the loser’s government with its ideal, and <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> will push <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> to its reversion point, making it indifferent between the trade wars outcome and its offer. Following Lemma 2, this will yield the following expected utility for <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[
\left[ \rho_i(\omega_i, \omega_j) G_i^w(a_i, a_j^{i \star}) + (1 - \rho_i(\omega_i, \omega_j) G_i^w(a_i^{j \star}, a_j) \right] ( 1 - c_i )
\]</span> If the absence of the hot wars option, government <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> simply receives its trade wars utility, <span class="math inline">\(G_i^w(a_i, a_j)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Government <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> will reject any offer and declare war whenever such an offer leaves it worse off than it expects to be under hot wars. Therefore, ‘hot wars’ will bind in determining bargaining outcomes whenever <span class="math display">\[
\left[ \rho_i(\omega_i, \omega_j) G_i^w(a_i, a_j^{i \star}) + (1 - \rho_i(\omega_i, \omega_j) G_i^w(a_i^{j \star}, a_j) \right] ( 1 - c_i ) &gt; G_i^w(a_i, a_j)
\]</span></p>
<p>Clearly, the likelihood of this condition binding depends on both the distribution of military capabilities <span class="math inline">\(\left\{ \omega_i, \omega_j \right\}\)</span> <em>and</em> the governments’ representativeness parameters <span class="math inline">\(\left\{ a_i, a_j \right\}\)</span>. Now consider a disribution of foreign country military capabilities, <span class="math inline">\(F:[\underline{\omega}, \overline{\omega}] \rightarrow [0,1]\)</span>. Proposition 2 examines the likelihood that ‘hot wars’ will bind for any draw from this distribution.</p>
<hr align="left", width="30%">
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Proposition 2:</strong> Suppose there exists some distribution of foreign government capabilities <span class="math inline">\(\omega_j \sim F\)</span>, let <span class="math inline">\(a_i, a_j &lt; \tilde{a}\)</span>, and fix <span class="math inline">\(c_i\)</span> and other underlying parameters. For any draw from <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>, then the probability that hot wars binds is increasing as <span class="math inline">\(a_i \rightarrow 0\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Proof:</strong> See <a href="04-appendix.html#prop2proof">Appendix</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr align="left", width="30%">
<p>Proposition 2 formalizes the intuition laid out at the beginning of this section. As <span class="math inline">\(a_i\)</span> gets smaller, conflicts of interest increase (Proposition 1). As a result, the government <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> has more at stake in the negotiation. While there may be cases in which trade wars and hot wars deliver similar distributional outcomes, this becomes less likely as conflicts of interest grow larger. The bargains made feasible by ‘hot wars’ and ‘trade wars’(depicted in Figure <a href="02-results.html#fig:bs">3.1</a>) become less and less likely to overlap. For these cases, at least one country prefers all outcomes induced by ‘hot wars’ to those induced by ‘trade wars’ and ‘hot wars’ will bind.</p>
<p><em>Note: I’m considering two possible directions for next steps with the model. Feedback welcome</em></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Maintain similar setup to the one derived above, but make the foreign country’s military capabilities private information. In line with standard bargaining and war models, this would induce home country to initiate hot war in some cases, and this would be more likely as conflict of interest grows larger. Advantage of this approach: Current model has no conflict, even though its ostensibly about conflict. With this model, I can draw a straight line from the domestic political economy to conflict propensity, which is the main point of the paper.</li>
<li>(Leaning this way) Introduce a new first step in the game where countries endogenously choose <span class="math inline">\(\omega_i\)</span> (military capability). Those with larger conflicts of interest more likely to choose high <span class="math inline">\(\omega_i\)</span>, because this determines the distributional outcome they ultimately live with. Disadvantage of this approach: still no real ‘conflict’ just differences in which outside option is employed. Advantage of this approach: it has interesting empirical content! I should be able to say something about states’ military spending as a function of domestic political economic characteristics. Introduces interesting opportunities for structural estimation.</li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Discussion</h2>
<p>The post-World War II era has been marked by 1) a large increase in international trade flows, 2) an increase in the number of democracies in the international system and 3) a relative dearth of interstate conflict. The democratic and commercial peace literatures largely see 1) and 2) as mollifying existing conflicts of interests between states - territorial, ideological, or otherwise - and in turn causing 3). The theory presented here takes a governments’ representativeness as exogenous and assumes that governments care about some weighted average of the components of social welfare. After imposing simple structure on the nature of governments’ interaction, it then generates trade policy, trade flows, and conflicts of interest endogeously from the same framework. Here, the same forces that drive the formation of trade policy drive governments’ conflict propensity.</p>
<p>The analysis demonstrates that representativeness, trade policy, conflicts of interest, and conflict propensity are all intimately related. Kleptocratic governments prefer to adopt trade policies that impose large externalities on other kleptocrats. By setting high tariffs, these governments cut into the profits of firms abroad, whose welfare becomes more important as the foreign government becomes more kleptocratic. This behavior both increases the returns to being able to replace foreign governments with puppets with more dovish preferences, and increases the costs of being forced to adopt the policies of a foreign-installed puppet. These counterfactual scenarios determine the magnitude of the conflict of interest governments face when interacting with one another, and the likelihood that governments will appeal to their militarized outside option when bargaining over trade policy.</p>
<p>The theory therefore sees 1) and 3) as endogenously emerging from 2). As governments have become more welfare-conscious they both adopt lower levels of trade protection and impose smaller negative externalities on one another. Rather than providing incentives for governments to resolve preexisting conflicts of interest, this behavior obviates conflicts of interest altogether. The theory rests on the assumption that in making foreign policy, governments are induced to care only about the (weighted) welfare of substate groups and the effect that theirs and others’ policies have on this welfare. While this is a standard assumption in the IPE literature <span class="citation">(Lake 2009)</span>, security and conflict scholars usually make more variegated assumptions on states’ preferences or simply assume that bargaining is taking place over some fixed ‘pie,’ valued equally by all states. The primary advantage of the approach taken here is that it is explicit the object of contention in international politics. This better captures substantial variation in the character and objectives of contemporary governments and facilitates analysis of how changes in preferences affect changes in behavior.</p>
<p>While the incidence of interstate conflict has declined dramatically since World War II, there remains substantial variation in both the rhetorical tenor and degree of militarization of contemporary international relations that is not captured by the ‘MID-or-not’<label for="tufte-sn-40" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">40</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-40" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">40</span> <a href="http://cow.dss.ucdavis.edu/data-sets/MIDs">MID: Militarized Interstate Dispute</a></span> classification often used by empirical conflict scholars. Some contemporary international relations are highly militarized and conflict-prone, with governments perceiving one another as national security threats, engaging in various forms of coercive diplomacy, and forgoing cooperation for fear of losing strategic avantage. In other cases, particularly relations amongst advanced industrial democracies, governments enjoy overwhelmingly warm relations. Their militaries make no preparations for war with one another, actively assisting one another in combating external security threats and resolving conflicts of interest through bilateral, noncoercive negotiations. To the extent that conflicts in security relations exist, they revolve around who will bear the burdens of collective self-defense, rather than any fundamental conflicts over ‘national interests.’ <span class="citation">Coe (n.d.)</span> terms this lack of antagonism “the modern economic peace,” and argues convincingly that existing theories struggle to explain it.</p>
<p>This empirical variation in foreign policy antagonism maps neatly to the model presented here. For dyads with small conflicts of interest, a coercive and noncoercive bargaining games deliver the same distributional outcomes. Military power is gratuitous and delivers no added effective bargaining power. These countries can therefore have common interests sufficient to demobilize their militaries and enjoy amicable, noncoercive political relations. While the same scenario can materialize for dyads with large countries of interest, it becomes much less likely. With sufficient military power, governments can guarantee themselves better distributional outcomes than pure trade talks would deliver, providing strong incentives to mobilize for war, demonstrate military capacity, and send costly signals of resolve to fight. Consistent with the stylized facts of the modern economic peace, the dyads most likely to experience comity of interest are those that are closest to the social welfare-maximizing ideal. While Western democracies certainly do not attain this ideal, their concern for their citizens welfare almost surely exceeds their autocratic counterparts <span class="citation">(Gawande, Krishna, and Olarreaga 2009)</span>.</p>
