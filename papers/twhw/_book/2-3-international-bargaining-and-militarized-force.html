<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> International Bargaining and Militarized Force</h2>
<p>Governments’ trade policies not only shift the domestic distribution of income, they also impose externalities, causing changes in the foreign distribution of income. Consider a tariff increase in the foreign country. As a result of higher domestic prices, imports contract and domestic producers pick up the slack. Consumers face higher prices, cutting into their welfare. The foreign government trades increases in producer surplus and tariff revenue for decreases in consumer surplus. This domestic political economy of trade is well-theorized <span class="citation">(Rogowski 1989; Grossman and Helpman 1994; Hiscox 2002)</span>. This behavior has implications for the home country as well, however. A tariff increase causes a downward shift in the international price. This causes a reduction in the profits of producers in the home country and an increase in consumption. The foreign government’s actions not only harms its own consumers, they also harm producers in the home country. When the home government weighs the interests of these producers above those of the consumers, the foreign country’s behavior imposes a negative externality.</p>
<p>Governments disatisfied with the market access conditions abroad have numerous tools at their disposal to seek changes in the trade policies of other governments. The most direct strategy is to simply solve trade conflicts through trade negotiations. Governments can trade policy concessions in order to realize pareto efficient outcomes <span class="citation">(Grossman and Helpman 1995; Davis 2004; Maggi 2016)</span>. Of course, such negotiations have distributional consequences that may favor certain actors at the expense of others. In the noncooperative trade wars game described in the previous subsection, actors with more intense preferences secure more advantageous outcomes.<label for="tufte-sn-15" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">15</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-15" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">15</span> Is this true? Maybe just focus on discussing distributional implications of trae wars outcome. If not, define stronger preferences…more at stake in the negotiation.</span> If trade policy instruments are the only tools available to secure bargaining advantage, then governments with weaker preference intensity will be forced to adopt trade policies closer to the ideal points of their trade partners. When trade policy conflicts of interest are sufficiently intense, these governments might prefer to tie non-trade inducements (positive or negative) to trade negotiations. The further the range of trade-only bargains is from a given government’s ideal point, the greater its incentives to manipulate others’ incentives through coercion. In the anarchy of world politics, coercion can always - in principle - take the form of threats, displays, or uses of military force <span class="citation">(Fearon 1997)</span>.<label for="tufte-sn-16" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">16</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-16" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">16</span> Instances of ‘gunboat diplomacy’ - in which military threats were unambiguously tied to market access conditions - are not difficult to find in the historical record.</span> The question considered here is under what circumstances governments will find pure trade negotiations insufficient to their ends and will be willing to risk military conflict to pursue these ends.</p>
<p>Here, I assume that war can be employed to replace a government with a type of the victor’s choosing. In the context of the model presented in the previous subsection, this means choosing the <span class="math inline">\(a_i\)</span> parameter that conditions the foreign government’s choice of trade policy. Since <span class="math inline">\(a_i\)</span> determines the ideal bilateral trade policy of each government, war can be used to move the ideal point of a trading partner closer to one’s own. This in turn moves the reversion point of the trade policy bargaining game and the set of feasible bargaining outcomes.<label for="tufte-sn-17" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">17</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-17" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">17</span> This also imposes limits on the magnitude of concessions that can be extracted through war. If the home government had control of both trade policy instruments <span class="math inline">\(\left\{ \tau_i, \tau_j \right\}\)</span>, it could use this power to redistribute an arbitrary amount of utility from the foreign government to itself. Because victorious governments only get to choose the (bounded) type of their negotiating partner, they can only obtain the concession that the most-favorable type of partner government would be willing to grant.</span> When contemplating a war, therefore, governments consider both the costs of the war and the benefits they would accrue if they were able to bargain with a partner holding more ‘dovish’ trade policy preferences. They also consider the outcome in which they lose a war and are replaced by a government of the foreign country’s choosing. In this case, the trade policy negotiated by the foreign-installed government is implemented, but the welfare changes resulting from the policy change are weighted by the old government’s utility function.<label for="tufte-sn-18" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">18</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-18" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">18</span> This assumption is consistent with the conceptualization of the government as an aggregation of substate actors. When contemplating a war, this aggregation considers its (weighted) change in welfare as a result of the imposition of new trade policies under the foreign-installed government. Importantly, unlike most bargaining and war games, this aggregation does not cease to exist (<span class="math inline">\(G_i \neq 0\)</span>) in the case of a war defeat.</span></p>
<p>The interaction between the governments proceeds as follows. I consider a take it or leave it bargaining game in which governments can choose whether to settle their differences through pure ‘trade talks’ <span class="citation">(Grossman and Helpman 1995)</span> or through the use of military force. Governments are each endowed with some exogenously-given military capability <span class="math inline">\(\omega_i \in \mathbb{R}_+\)</span>.<label for="tufte-sn-19" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">19</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-19" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">19</span> A possible extension to the model would endogenize military capability and seek to explain states’ military investment decisions as a function of political/economic primitives. This might be a more tractable dependent variable than conflict. Feedback welcome here.</span> A contest function <span class="math inline">\(\rho: \left\{ \omega_i, \omega_j \right\} \rightarrow [0, 1]\)</span> determines the probability that government <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> prevails in war for control of the type of <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>’s government. This contest function is assumed to be increasing and weakly concave in <span class="math inline">\(\omega_i\)</span>, to be decreasing and weakly convex in <span class="math inline">\(\omega_j\)</span> and to satisfy the law of total probability <span class="math inline">\(\rho(\omega_i, \omega_j) + \rho(\omega_j, \omega_i) = 1\)</span>. <label for="tufte-mn-7" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-7" class="margin-toggle"><span class="marginnote"><span style="display: block;">The commonly used ‘additive’ contest function <span class="citation"><span class="citation">(Jia, Skaperdas, and Vaidya 2013)</span></span> satisfies these conditions for <span class="math inline"><em>ω</em> ∈ ℝ<sub>++</sub></span> with <br /><span class="math display"><span class="math display">\[ \rho(\omega_i, \omega_j) = \frac{\omega_i}{\omega_i + \omega_j} \]</span></span><br /></span></span> If either state chooses to engage in a war, both governments pay fixed proportion of their post-war welfare, denoted <span class="math inline">\(c_i \in [0,1]\)</span>. Country <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> wins the war with probability <span class="math inline">\(\rho(\omega_i, \omega_j)\)</span> and can then replace <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>’s government with an alternative government of its choosing. The value of winning a war stems from the ability to choose the type of government that one will bargain with in future trade policy negotiations. Of course, if <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> loses the war, then <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> replaces <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>’s government.</p>
<p>In the bargaining game, government <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> offers a trade policy pair <span class="math inline">\(\left\{ \tau_i^j, \tau_j^j \right\}\)</span> and some side payment <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> to country <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>.<label for="tufte-sn-20" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">20</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-20" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">20</span> <span class="citation">Grossman and Helpman (1995)</span> prove the distributional equivalence between 1) a fixed trade policy pair <span class="math inline">\(\left\{ \tau_i^j, \tau_j^j \right\}\)</span> and a side payment and 2) a fixed trade policy ratio (<span class="math inline">\(\tau_i / \tau_j\)</span>) and a trade policy ‘level’ <span class="math inline">\(\tau_j\)</span>. Essentially, they show that governments can use trade policy to implement an arbitrary division of utility through its affect on tariff revenues (or subsidy costs). I introduce a side payment here to distinguish between efficiency and distributional considerations, but the analysis holds if governments are prohibited from using side payments. Unlike in <span class="citation">Grossman and Helpman (1995)</span>, the side payment is assumed to contribute directly to governments’ utilities, where <span class="math display">\[G_i^t = G_i(\tau_i, \tau_j) + R\]</span></span> Then, country <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> takes one of three actions.</p>

</ol>
<p>The game presents government <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> with a relatively straightforward decision. If it is not satisfied with <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>’s offer, it can either walk away from the negotiating table or try to replace <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>’s government. A subgame perfect equilibrium of this game will always be efficient. Government <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> will make the minimal concession that prevents both trade wars and hot wars.<label for="tufte-sn-24" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">24</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-24" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">24</span> The take-it-or-leave it protocol allows <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> to extract all bargaining surplus. <em>use NBS</em></span> The question I consider here is under what conditions the ‘hot wars’ outcome will ‘bind’ in determining bargaining outcomes.</p>
<p>This requires reasoning backward from the expected outcome of such a ‘hot war.’ Suppose, without loss of generality, that country <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> wins the war. It will then choose the type of country <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>, denoted <span class="math inline">\(a_j^i\)</span>, and make a bilateral trade policy offer that the puppet <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> government can accept or reject, where rejection imposes the trade wars equilibrium for <span class="math inline">\(a_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(a_j^i\)</span>. Naturally, <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> will extract the bargaining surplus and bargaining will be efficient. This yields Lemma 2.</p>

<p>In the bargaining game described in Lemma 2, the governments choose the pareto efficient trade policy, and then redistribute income amongst themselves such that <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> is indifferent between the realized bargain and the trade wars outcome. The resulting utility for government <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, therefore, is dependent on both its own type <span class="math inline">\(a_i\)</span>, but also the type of its negotiating partner, <span class="math inline">\(a_j\)</span>.

Since government <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> will receive <span class="math inline">\(\overline{G}_i(\tau_i^t, \tau_j^t; a_i, a_j)\)</span> in any bargain, it would like to choose <span class="math inline">\(a_j\)</span> to maximize this quantity.

<p>The utility the victorious government receives, <span class="math inline">\(\overline{G}_i\)</span> is simply its utility under the bargaining game in which it optimally chooses the type of its trading partner. The utility of the losing government is slightly more complicated. <span class="math inline">\(\underline{G}_j\)</span> is determined by how the <em>old</em> government evaluates the policy agreed upon by the victor and the <em>new</em> puppet government. It is therefore a function of the original type of country <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>’s government, <span class="math inline">\(a_j\)</span>, the type of the victorious government, <span class="math inline">\(a_i\)</span>, and the type of the puppet installed by the victor, <span class="math inline">\(a_j^{i \star}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="2-3-international-bargaining-and-militarized-force.html#fig:bs">2.3</a> depicts this bargaining game for the parametric model presented above. The first panel shows both governments’ best response curves and the ‘trade wars’ bilateral trade policy that is realized at their intersection. The points IP1 and IP2 correspond to the bilateral trade policies that are implemented when countries 1 and 2 choose the type of their bargaining partner. The dotted ‘efficiency locus’ depicts the set of bilateral trade policies that maximize joint surplus. This can be thought of as a ‘distributional axis.’ Governments have strictly conflicting preferences over where on this ray bilateral trade policy will settle.<label for="tufte-sn-27" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">27</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-27" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">27</span> This also generates the one-to-one mapping between bargains with and without side payments.</span> As discussed above, however, the set of feasible policies is (implicitly) limited by the bounded set (<span class="math inline">\(a_i \in [0,1]\)</span>) of government types. The second panel depicts the distributional implications of these trade policies. The solid diagonal line is the set of pareto efficient agreements. Beneath this line are the ‘trade wars’ and ‘hot wars’ reversion points. The dotted lines emanating from these points toward the pareto frontier enclose the set of induced utilities that are preferred by both governments to a given outside option. These sets make it relatively easy to see when the ‘hot wars’ outside option will bind. When these sets do not intersect, at least one government prefers initiating a hot war to <em>any</em> agreement in the ‘trade wars’ set. In accordance with the bargaining game described above, ‘hot wars’ will therefore bind in determining bargaining outcomes.<label for="tufte-sn-28" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">28</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-28" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">28</span> The set of cases in which ‘hot wars’ binds can be larger, depending on the specifics of the bargaining protocol.

\left[ \rho_i(\omega_i, \omega_j) G_i^w(a_i, a_j^{i \star}) + (1 - \rho_i(\omega_i, \omega_j) G_i^w(a_i^{j \star}, a_j) \right] ( 1 - c_i )
\]</span> If the absence of the hot wars option, government <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> simply receives its trade wars utility, <span class="math inline">\(G_i^w(a_i, a_j)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Government <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> will reject any offer and declare war whenever such an offer leaves it worse off than it expects to be under hot wars. Therefore, ‘hot wars’ will bind in determining bargaining outcomes whenever <span class="math display">\[
\left[ \rho_i(\omega_i, \omega_j) G_i^w(a_i, a_j^{i \star}) + (1 - \rho_i(\omega_i, \omega_j) G_i^w(a_i^{j \star}, a_j) \right] ( 1 - c_i ) &gt; G_i^w(a_i, a_j)
\]</span></p>
