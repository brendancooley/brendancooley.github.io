<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>Since <span class="citation">Fearon (1995)</span>, international conflict has been understood as resulting from bargaining failures. The fact that war is costly provides incentives for governments to settle their disputes peacefully. The central puzzle of war, therefore, is that “wars are costly yet nonetheless wars recur.”</p>
<p>To focus more closely on this puzzle, Fearon assumed the existence of a ‘pie’ over which governments would bargain. Both governments place the same valuation on the pie, and only derive utility from their own consumption of it. To fix ideas, theorists often refer to this pie as ‘territory.’ In abstracting away from the exact nature of the dispute at hand, the model directs our attention away from the question of why international disputes emerge in the first place. What do governments want, and why do their objectives bring them into conflict with one another? To explain salient patterns of international conflict and cooperation, this question must be answered first <span class="citation">(Moravcsik 1997)</span>.</p>
<p>Here, I layer Fearon’s bargaining model on top of a two-country model of trade inspired by <span class="citation">Grossman and Helpman (1995)</span>. I build a simple domestic political economy of trade that defines governments’ preferences and explore how changes in economic and political primitives affect the bargaining environment and, in turn, governments’ conflict propensity. International bargaining centers around determining who will bear the burden of the externalities these governments impose on one another through their trade policies. The results shed light on ongoing debates in international relations. Why are democratic dyads less likely to engage in militarized interstate disputes <span class="citation">(Russett and Oneal 2001)</span>? Does international economic integration promote peace <span class="citation">(Gartzke 2007)</span>?</p>
<p>The standard, bare bones bargaining model as developed by Fearon is ill-equipped to answer these questions. Taken literally, the model envisions a world of undifferentiated governments that hold homogenous preferences over the consumption of some private good, such as territory. Domestic political characteristics can only influence patterns of international conflict insofar as they change the distribution of information <span class="citation">(Schultz 1998)</span> or provide governments with otherwise unavailable commitment devices. While such a model may capture salient features of the interaction between warlords, kingpins, or monarchs from bygone eras, it fails to capture variation in the foreign policy objectives and implied conflicts of interest of contemporary governments.</p>
<p>I assume here that rather than seeking to maximize their territorial footprint, governments instead care about the welfare of substate social groups. Because the welfare of these groups is affected by the policies of both their own government and governments abroad, the government has preferences over both its own policy and the policy of foreign governments. Governments preside over a two-sector economy and set trade policies (tariffs or subsidies) for those sectors. One sector is endowed with a specific factor of production, and seeks to influence the goverment’s choice of trade policy through political contributions.<label for="tufte-sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">1</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-1" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">1</span> The other ‘numeraire’ sector employs only labor, makes no profit, and serves only to pin down the competitive wage and distribution of labor across sectors. The actors in the model are the governments and the non-numeraire sectors.</span> Following <span class="citation">Grossman and Helpman (1994)</span>, I conceptualize governments as lying on a spectrum from pure kleptocracies to pure social welfare maximizers. Kleptocrats seek to maximize rents (political contributions), while the policies of social welfare maximizers are unaffected by contributions.</p>
<p>As the model demonstrates, conflicts of interest vary dramatically as a function of <em>whose</em> welfare the government internalizes. When the government is a benevolent social welfare maximizer, ideal home policies impose small externalities on foreign governments, yielding largely harmonious preferences. By contrast, kleptocrat’s optimal policies impose large externalities on foreign governments, yielding larger conflicts of interest.</p>
<p>Once preferences have been defined, I embed these governments in a simple bargaining model. <span class="citation">Grossman and Helpman (1995)</span> consider a model of ‘trade wars and trade talks,’ in which the bilateral trade policy that would emerge during a noncooperative trade war determines the range of cooperative outcomes the governments bargain over. Here, I endow the governments with militaries that they can employ in a bid to replace the government of their opponent. War is modeled as a costly lottery, in which the winner imposes its own optimal trade policy on its opponent. Governments therefore possess two outside options - trade wars and hot wars - which condition bargaining outcomes. When the bargaining range defined by trade wars is interior to the range defined by hot wars, the trade wars option binds in determining bilateral trade policy. However, when these ranges do not overlap, the militarized option binds.<label for="tufte-sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">2</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-2" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">2</span> In this paper, I assume away bargaining frictions in order to consider variation in which outside option binds as a function of domestic political and economic characteristics. Bargaining is efficient and war never occurs. In future iterations of this paper, I plan to consider a dynamic variant of this model in which conflict might occur in equilibrium.</span> The likelihood of the militarized option binding is a function of domestic political and economic characteristics, as well as the distribution of military power between the governments.</p>
<p>The model provides a novel explanation for the comity between advanced democracies, a phenomenon <span class="citation">Coe (n.d.)</span> terms the “modern economic peace.” The United States, the European Union, Japan, and other advanced democracies not only do not come into militarized conflict with one another - they do not consider one another to be security threats at all. The United States even encourages Japan and the European Union to invest <em>more</em> in their militaries, behavior that is extremely puzzling from the perspective of classical IR theory.<label for="tufte-sn-3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">3</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-3" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">3</span> In a 2011 speech in Brussels, U.S. defense secretary Robert Gates implored NATO allies to increase defense spending. (See Thom Shanker, “<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/11/world/europe/11gates.html">Defense Secretary Warns NATO of ‘Dim’ Future</a>,” <em>The New York Times</em>, June 10, 2011.) The United States and Japan signed a wide-ranging agreement in 2016, committing Japan to play a larger security role in East Asia. (See Julie Hirschfeld Davis and Michael R. Gordon, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/28/world/asia/japan-and-us-set-new-rules-for-military-cooperation.html">“Japan and U.S. Set New Rules for Military”</a>, <em>The New York Times</em>, April 27, 2015.)</span></p>
<p>Scholars have long debated whether it is these countries’ institutional or economic properties that make them so immune to belligerent foreign relations <span class="citation">(Russett and Oneal 2001; Gartzke 2007)</span>. Adherents of a capitalist, or, commercial peace, argue that economic integration increases the opportunity costs of conflict and provides non-militarized mechanisms through which states can signal interest and resolve <span class="citation">(Gartzke, Li, and Boehmer 2001)</span>. The opportunity cost logic rests on the assumption governments value potential gains from trade. But as <span class="citation">Gawande, Krishna, and Olarreaga (2009)</span> show, few governments actually appear to exhibit such preferences. Why, then, should these governments view conflict as inducing opportunity costs? If they are sufficiently mercantilist, trade-disrupting conflict might improve their welfare, as it decreases the amount of competition facing domestic industries <span class="citation">(Chatagnier and Kavakli 2015)</span>.</p>
<p>Trade is endogenous to the model presented here. Governments can always choose to close their markets to foreign competition. When they are sufficiently social welfare-conscious, they will prefer not to do so, valuing the gains from trade more highly than the rents accrued from protectionist special interests. If we view democracies as more akin to social welfare maximizers than kleptocrats, then this provides a mechanism through which democracy can affect the magnitude of conflicts of interest between governments.<label for="tufte-sn-4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">4</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-4" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">4</span> <span class="citation">Milner and Kubota (2005)</span> provide evidence that when setting trade policy, democracies indeed do better approximate the social welfare maximizing ideal than their autocratic counterparts.</span> Because ‘democratic’ dyads prefer to adopt lower degrees of distortionary trade policy, they both trade more and have more common interests than their kleptocratic counterparts. In this sense, trade is not causing peace. Peace emerges because these governments have nothing worth fighting over.</p>
<p>Several other studies have sought to connect governments’ biases to international conflict behavior. <span class="citation">Putnam (1988)</span> and <span class="citation">Milner (1997)</span> both develop international bargaining games in which preferences are determined by domestic political characteristics. <span class="citation">Lake (1992)</span> argues that rent-seeking states demonstrate an ‘imperialist bias,’ international expansionism delivers increased rents to the ruling coalition. As <span class="citation">Fearon (2008)</span> notes, incentives for predation disappear rapidly as governments internalize the interests of the average citizen. <span class="citation">Jackson and Morelli (2007)</span> show that leaders that accrue disproportionate gains from foreign wars are more belligerent and secure more advantageous bargaining outcomes on behalf of their citizens. This paper provides firm political-economic foundations for these findings. Rather than exploring the impact of government bias in some arbitrary bargaining space, the model developed here derives government preferences over a general equilibrium trade model, in which the governments’ policy choices directly affect the welfare of the agents they care about. Underlying international conflicts are disagreements over what prices domestic producers and consumers will face domestically and internationally. The model shares many features with that of <span class="citation">Coe (n.d.)</span>. The major difference is that comity of interest in this model stems not from the long run growth prospects of democracies, but the short term externalities they impose on one another through trade policy.</p>
<p>The paper proceeds as follows. The next section lays out the model and its political economic foundations. It shows how the domestic political economy shapes government preferences and describes how governments interact within the model. Section 3 derives the model’s key results, showing the conflicts of interest between the governments, and the types of international relations they induce, vary systematically based on the degree to which governments maximize social welfare versus rents. Section 4 concludes by discussing the model’s implications for existing explanations of the commercial peace and democratic peace. Proofs accompanying the main results are included in the Appendix.</p>
