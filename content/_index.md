I currently work as a quantitative analyst for the Los Angeles Dodgers. I received my Ph.D. in Politics at Princeton University in 2020. In my dissertation research, I estimated a model of the world political economy to quantify how military coercion affects international trade. At Princeton, I taught the Politics Department's summer math course for incoming graduate students, along with [Daniel Gibbs](http://www.daniel-gibbs.com/).

I'm interested in baseball, cities, open source software, and open science. I live in the Washington, DC area.

In 2021 I [recorded a podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/26-trade-war-and-china-with-brendan-cooley/id1525164585?i=1000506571235) for Narratives with Will Jarvis. We chatted about why China and the United States don't get along.
